            "Growth inhibition of the NCI-H23 human Non-Small Cell Lung tumor cell line is measured as a screen for anti-cancer activity. Cells are grown in 96 well plates and exposed to the test compound for 48 hours. Compounds are tested at 5 different concentrations and three endpoints are estimated from this dose response curve: GI50, concentration required for 50% inhibition of growth, TGI, the concentration requires for complete inhibition of growth, and LC50, the concentration required for 50% reduction in cell number. These estimates are done by simple linear interpolation between the concentrations that surround the approriate level. If a compound doesn't cause inhibition to the appropriate level, the endpoint is set to the highest concentration tested. "
