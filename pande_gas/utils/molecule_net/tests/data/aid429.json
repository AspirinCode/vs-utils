            "Hsp90 is a chaperon with important roles in maintaining transformation and in elevating the survival and growth  potential of cancer cells.  Recent evidence suggests additional applications of Hsp90 inhibitors in  neurodegenerative diseases, nerve injuries, inflammation and infection.  Several natural products that inactivate  Hsp90 function have anti-tumor effects in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer. However, due to the role of Hsp90  in normal cellular homeostasis, it remained unclear whether Hsp90 inhibitors will be sufficiently specific for use  as therapeutic agents.  Early clinical results with 17AAG, the first Hsp90 inhibitor to enter clinical trials,  confirm that Hsp90 is a promising target for novel cancer therapeutics and pave the road for the introduction of  Hsp90 inhibitors in the clinic. The potential of Hsp90 inhibitors as therapeutics in other diseases has been less  explored. Currently there is thus, increasing interest in developing novel inhibitors of this protein.",

            "We have developed and optimized a fluorescence polarization based HTS assay for the identification of Hsp90  inhibitors by using tumor cell lysate Hsp90. Geldanamycin (GM) is a natural product that inhibits Hsp90 by binding  to its ATP pocket. The FP assay for the Hsp90 in cell lysate is based on the competitive binding of fluorescently  (Cy3B) labeled geldanamycin (cy3B-GM) to average Hsp90 population found in cancer cell lysate (Y. Du, K. Moulick,  J. Aguirre, H. Fu, G. Chiosis. Development of a high-throughput screening fluorescence polarization assay for  thetumor Hsp90. Manuscript in preparation)."
